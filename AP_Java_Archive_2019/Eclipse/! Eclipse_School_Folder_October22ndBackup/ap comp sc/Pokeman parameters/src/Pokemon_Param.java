/* Assignment Info
A Pokémon's base stat values will most often have the greatest influence over their specific stats at any level. 
A level 100 Pokémon's stats in Attack, Defense, Speed, Special Attack, and Special Defense will be exactly 5 more than double its base stat values in each.
The Hit Points (HP) stat will be 110 plus double the base stat value.
Write a program that returns a Pokémon’s stats for Attack and HP at level 100.
You should use parameters and methods that return values for this program. 
You may choose to use the base stats for Blastoise OR Raichu given here:
Blastoise 
HP: 79
Attack: 83
Defense: 100
Special Attack: 85
Special Defense: 105
Speed: 78
Raichu
HP: 60
Attack: 90
Defense: 55
Special Attack: 90
Special Defense: 80
Speed: 110
